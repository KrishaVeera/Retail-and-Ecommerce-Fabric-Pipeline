# Retail-and-Ecommerce-Fabric-Pipeline

üåê End-to-End Project Idea
‚ÄúRetail & E-Commerce Analytics Platform‚Äù

üîπ Data Sources (to cover variety)
Structured (batch) ‚Äì Sales transactions, customer info, product catalog (CSV/SQL).
Semi-structured ‚Äì JSON logs from the website & mobile app (clickstream, searches).
Unstructured ‚Äì Customer feedback text reviews.
Streaming ‚Äì IoT inventory sensors (stock updates) + simulated order events (Kafka/Event Hub feed).

üîπ Pipeline Components
1. Implement & Manage
Create Fabric workspace (Lakehouse, Warehouse, Eventhouse).
Apply security (workspace RBAC, row-level for sensitive sales, masking emails).
Enable version control for notebooks/pipelines.
Add logging + monitoring.

2. Ingest & Transform
Batch ingestion: Load CSVs (sales, products) into Lakehouse with pipelines.
Incremental loads: Only new orders daily (simulate inserts).

Streaming ingestion:
Use Eventstream to capture real-time order events.
Use Eventhouse for IoT stock sensor telemetry.

Transformations:
Clean sales data (SQL & Dataflow Gen2).
Use PySpark to denormalize clickstream + sales for customer journey analysis.
Use KQL to aggregate streaming events for real-time dashboards.
Handle late/missing data with Spark windowing.

3. Model & Store
Store processed batch & streaming data in Lakehouse (parquet/delta).
Create Warehouse tables (T-SQL) for BI models.
Prep dimensional schema (fact_sales, dim_customer, dim_product).

4. Orchestration
Pipelines to run batch ETL nightly.
Notebooks for advanced Spark/PySpark transformations.
Parameterize pipelines (date range, file path).
Trigger event-based orchestrations when new files land.

5. Monitor & Optimize
Monitor refresh status of Lakehouse/Warehouse.
Add alerts for pipeline failures.
Tune queries (optimize delta tables, partitioning).
Benchmark Spark jobs and adjust cluster size.
Optimize semantic model refresh in Power BI.

Outputs / Dashboards (Power BI)
Sales Trends Dashboard ‚Üí revenue, profit, top products.
Customer 360 View ‚Üí churn risk, lifetime value, sentiment from reviews.
Real-Time Orders & Inventory Dashboard ‚Üí live order feed, low-stock alerts.
Operational Performance Dashboard ‚Üí pipeline run times, data latency, system health.

This single project check every DP-700 box:
Batch + incremental ingestion (sales, products).
Streaming ingestion (orders, IoT).
Transformations with SQL, PySpark, KQL, Dataflows.
Lakehouse + Warehouse modeling.

Governance/security (RLS, masking, labels).

Orchestration with pipelines & notebooks.

Monitoring & optimization end-to-end.
